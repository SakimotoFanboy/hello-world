# hello-world
It's important to learn new things.

This is why I am doing this. And if you're reading this, odds are, you're either into learning things too - or you're simply a weird stalker who decided to find me on GitHub and check out what I'm doing. This is strange and I do not understand why you would do this.

Anyway - Hello, World!
